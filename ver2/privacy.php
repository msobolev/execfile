            <p>Protecting  the privacy and anonymity of our subscribers is important to us. This  privacy policy covers how, when and why we collect and use information  about our subscribers. Please read this policy carefully and review it  often because it may change. </p>
            <h2>Overview </h2>

                <li>We  do not use or share personally identifiable information other than as  described in this privacy statement. We may disclose such information  as required by law or to protect our interests or the rights of third  parties. </li>
                <li>We communicate with our subscribers by email. We do not give or sell email addresses to anyone for their marketing purposes.</li>
                <li>We secure information we collect using generally accepted industry standards. </li>
                <li> This privacy statement may change at any time and changes take effect when posted unless otherwise indicated.</li>
                <li>We  will cooperate with legal inquiries and requests made by third parties  to enforce laws or to protect their rights. Although subscribers are  anonymous while using our website, the improper or illegal use of our  website can jeopardize that anonymity.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Payment Information</h2>
            <p>To  open a subscription account, subscribers must enter valid credit card  and/or other payment information needed to process their subscription  payments. We use this information for identification and verification  purposes and to process payments. We may also use this information to  contact subscribers about payment processing. When subscribers provide  payment information, it is not stored anywhere on our website, instead  it is seamlessly integrated with PayPal Merchant Solutions that has  highest in the industry security standards and protocols. </p>
            <h2>Sharing Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
            <p>We do not share personally identifiable information about our subscribers except as follows: </p>
            <h2>Agents</h2>
            <p>We  use an outside company (PayPal) to process subscription payments. This  processing company does not retain, share, store or use subscriber  payment information for any other purposes. </p>
            <h2>Service Providers</h2>
            <p>We  use third parties service providers for network, security, email and  hosting services for our website. We will only provide subscriber  information that is necessary for third parties to provide their  respective services to us. These third parties are prohibited from  using personally identifiable information for any other purposes. </p>
            <h2>Communicating with our Subscribers</h2>
            <p>We  will typically communicate with our subscribers using their registered  email address. We do not share or sell email addresses to anyone for  their marketing purposes. If we cannot reach our subscribers by email,  we may use other contact information such as their address or telephone  number. We will communicate with subscribers in accordance with their  preferences and in response to inquiries, to provide requested services  and to manage their accounts. </p>
            <h2>Service-related Announcements</h2>
            <p>We  will send subscribers mandatory service-related announcements and  notifications by email when necessary. Subscribers cannot opt-out of  these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If  subscribers do not wish to receive them, they have the option of  canceling their subscription. We may broadcast important messages to  all users or send individual messages to specific subscribers. </p>
            <h2>Access to Information</h2>
            <p>Subscribers  may access and change their registration information using the \'My  Profile&rsquo; area provided by the website. Subscribers may change their  email address, other contact information, payment information, optional  personal profile, and their sharing, use and communication preferences.  Subscribers may access other information collected and processed about  them by using standard system functionality. To access any other  subscriber related information, if any, subscribers may email us at <a href=\"mailto:ms@hrexecsonthemove.com\">ms@hrexecsonthemove.com</a> </p>
            <h2>Information Security</h2>
            <h2>Generally accepted standards</h2>
            <p>We  follow generally accepted industry standards to protect all information  collected by us. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect  information against loss, theft and unauthorized access or disclosure  during transmission and once we receive it. Perfect security does not  exist on the Internet and no method of transmission or electronic  storage is completely secure. While we work hard to use commercially  acceptable means to protect the information, we cannot guarantee its  absolute security. </p>
            <h2>Passwords</h2>
            <p>During  registration, subscribers are assigned a randomly generated password.  Passwords are used to secure subscriber information and the integrity  of the website. We only store a one-way encryption of subscriber  passwords which means passwords cannot be unencrypted by us. Our login  page provides a way for subscribers to obtain access to the website in  case they lose or forget their password. </p>
            <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>Our  website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled  by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those other  sites. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by  us through our website. You should keep aware of when you leave our  site and read the privacy statements of each and every other web site  that collects your personally identifiable information. </p>
            <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We  reserve the right to change this privacy statement at any time, so  please review it frequently. We will post changes to this statement,  our homepage, and other places that we deem appropriate so our  subscribers are aware of what information we collect, how we use it,  and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Changes shall  automatically be effective when posted unless otherwise indicated. If  we make material changes to this policy, we may notify subscribers by  email or by other prominent means online. </p>
            <h2>Legal Requests</h2>
            <p>We  will cooperate with law enforcement inquiries. In response to a  verified request by law enforcement or other government officials  relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we  may disclose subscriber information, including personally identifiable  information, without a subpoena. </p>
            <p>Except  as otherwise described herein, we will not disclose subscriber  information, including personally identifiable information, without a  subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal process or  procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of  such information is necessary to report suspected illegal or improper  activity, protect our rights or interests, protect our subscribers&rsquo;  rights or interests, protect the rights or interests of third parties,  or enforce our policies and procedures. </p>
